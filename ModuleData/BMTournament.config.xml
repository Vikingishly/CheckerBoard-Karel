    PrizeListMode can be:
    Vanilla - this will use the standard prizes of the vanilla game - it will disable the prize selection code of the mod 
    Custom - this will load the prizes from the BMTournamentPrizeList.json file - this will not include the standard prizes - however they are by default in the custom json file.
    TownOnly - this will generate prizes based on the current towns inventory ONLY - it will not include the standard/custom prizes - WARNING - if you set the TownPrizeMin/Max to too narrow of a filter, it can cause problems generating tournaments.  I'm adding safeguards and checks as I discover them.
    TownVanilla - this will generate prizes based on the current towns inventory AND also allow options from Vanilla Game
    TownCustom - this will generate prizes based on the current towns inventory AND also allow options from Custom
